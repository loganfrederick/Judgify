echo'<h1>Judgify Forum- Terms of Service</h1>
<h3>Registration Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to post messages on the Judgify forums, you are required to register with Judgify using an email address. Thorough understanding of the Terms of Service, henceforth known as the TOS, is optional, though recommended. You are subject to the rules and terms shown here, and by posting on the Judgify boards, you accept these terms. These rules may be changed at any time without prior notice, so it is recommended to review this page regularly. Judgify does not require you to use your real name or other identification that can be easily traced to you, and the email address you provide will be kept private. In order to register on our forums, registrants must be 13 years of age or older, and if it is found that an underage user has fraudulently registered, their account will immediately be terminated in order to comply with government underage internet usage laws.</p>

<h3>Responsibility</h3>
<p>Judgify is not responsible for screening content before it is posted and may not be held in any way, shape, or form for any harm or loss that may come to you or others as a result of viewing this content. Users are solely responsible for protecting their accounts from access by others. You are strongly encouraged to select a hard-to-guess password and not re-use that password on any other sites where it may be read by the owners or administrators of that site. It is also highly discouraged that GameSource accounts be shared with others, as the actions of some other person could easily directly impact all known shared message board accounts. In cases of certain severe and/or repeated TOS violations or illegal activities, we reserve the right to forward any and all known information about you and your accounts to your ISP (including libraries, schools, and places of employment), email service provider, your ISP account owner (if someone else is actually paying for it), and any parties whose copyright has clearly been infringed by your actions on the boards. Intentional, repeated, or severe violations are cause for the banning of your account, all use of the boards from your IP address or your entire ISP, and Judgify contacting your ISP or other relevant parties concerning your activities.</p>

<h3>MEMBER CONDUCT</h3>
<p>You agree that you will not use this service to perform the following actions (which include, but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Offensive Posting: Racism, flaming, trolling, linking to offensive images without warning</li>
<li>Disruptive Posting: Posts or topic titles that force browsers to scroll horizontally, linking to harmful sites without warning, large blank posts, misuse of HTML, reposting any deleted violation, any other posting habits that may cause detriment to the boards\' natural flow.</li>
<li>Board Invasion: Declaring, instigating, or participating in the invasion of any board, or flooding a board with multiple disruptive topics.</li>
<li>Spamming/Advertising: You may advertise in a signature, but posts containing spam will be eliminated faster than the Virtual Boy\'s lifespan.</li>
<li>Filter Bypassing: We have censors in messages for a reason. I enjoy swearing as much as the next guy, but please, keep the boards clean and civilized.</li>
<li>Impersonation: This goes for imitating other users. However, you can make fun of the site\'s staff and famous celebrities all you want. And anyone with the name supervegetagoku69.</li>
<li>Unauthorized Access, Bugs, and Exploits: Its just not nice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Violating any of the above rules with a username, or any part of the user profile (signature, quote, email, IM) is considered a severe violation.</p>

<p>Any other activity that is clearly detrimental to the flow of conversation and normal activities of the boards and its users may also be deleted.</p>

<h3>TERMS VIOLATIONS</h3>

<p>Topics and message posts that violate the TOS will be deleted from the boards at any time, and additional penalties, such as post loss, or the loss of a user accounts privileges may be applied at the moderator\'s discretion. All determinations of what is "acceptable" and "unacceptable" content will be determined solely by designated moderators as well. You agree that the decision of the moderators and administrators is final, and your resistance is futile against our dictatorship. Have a nice day and thank you for reading the Terms of Service!</p>';
